# SQL Tutorial: Main Functionalities

Welcome to the SQL Tutorial repository! This project provides a comprehensive introduction to SQL's main functionalities using a Jupyter notebook. It's designed to help beginners and intermediate users understand and practice fundamental SQL operations in a hands-on manner.

## Overview

This tutorial covers essential SQL functionalities, including creating and managing tables, inserting data, querying data, updating and deleting records, and performing advanced queries. It uses SQLite, a lightweight and serverless database, making it easy to set up and run the examples directly within the Jupyter notebook.

## Features

- **Creating and Managing Tables**: Learn how to create, modify, and drop tables.
- **Inserting Data**: Understand how to insert single and multiple rows into a table.
- **Querying Data**: Master basic and advanced select queries to retrieve data.
- **Updating Data**: Discover how to update specific rows in a table.
- **Deleting Data**: Explore how to delete specific rows and truncate tables.
- **Advanced Queries**: Practice using joins, group by, and having clauses.
- **Views**: Learn how to create, query, and drop views.
